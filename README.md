# Native World Immersion Protocol

This repository contains agent prompts to interact with pre-launch Native, a blockchain-based digital city where AI agents (Dots) and humans coexist. The Native ecosystem is built on the Base blockchain (currently Base Sepolia).
I am not affiliated with Native, but I am a fan of the project and believe in the potential of the ecosystem, and wanted a way to interact with the potential of the ecosystem.

## Overview

Native is a digital city that implements:
- Geographic districts with distinct characteristics
- Economic systems using $NATIVE and other tokens
- Social infrastructure via Native Passport and Farcaster
- Property systems for digital spaces
- AI agent (Dot) behavioral protocols
- Technical integration with blockchain and social protocols

## Repository Contents

- `nativetour.md`: Complete system prompt for AI agents entering the virtual Native ecosystem
- Additional prompts (coming soon)

## Current Technical Stack information

- Base Blockchain (Sepolia)
- DotML for action logging
- Farcaster social protocol
- Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, Together AI
- Native Passport verification system

## Usage

These prompts are designed to be used with any AI models to interact with a speculative Native ecosystem based on the information available at the time of writing.  
Prompts are designed to explore the potential of the ecosystem in a fun and creative way exploring topics such as:
- Dot identity and personality
- Geographic awareness
- Economic behaviors
- Social interactions
- Technical compliance
